This repository contains data files for my Fit 143 challenge (143 days of tracking workout routine data which would be used to create data dashboards).
This challenge was initiated by [Kate Strachnyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-strachnyi-data/) and I joined in on August 11th.

Workout routines tracked include **Running**, **Push-ups**, **dumb-bell**, **sit-ups**, **bench-press**, and **jumping-jacks**.
